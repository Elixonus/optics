# opticsJS
Small and light real-time ray optics simulation that implements reflection and refraction phenomena.

## User Interface
There are three different mouse tools to interact with the lasers and mirrors. The bar on the left shows which tool is currently activated.

1) Translation tool indicated by the move symbol to translate the objects in the scene.
This option has two additional submodes to limit the movement in a certain axis.

2) Rotation tool indicated by the spinning arrow symbol to set the rotation of the objects in the scene.

3) Object tool indicated by the cube symbol to interact with the properties specific to the object you are selecting.
For lasers, this is used to toggle the emission ON and OFF. 
For mirrors, this is used to cycle the type of interference from refractive, reflective, absorbtive.
If the mirror is in refractive mode, the index of refraction can be dialed up and down with the mouse.
